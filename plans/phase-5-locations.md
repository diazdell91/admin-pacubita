### 🔄 Location Workflows

- [ ] **Location Creation Workflow**
  1. Location type selection
  2. Parent location selection
  3. Basic information entry
  4. Geographic data input
  5. Service area definition
  6. Validation and creation
- [ ] **Hierarchy Management**
  - Move locations between parents
